You've learned to create custom layers for deck.gl with advanced techniques such as creating a composite layer and extending an existing layer.

Still have questions? Read the [documentation](https://uber.github.io/deck.gl/#/documentation/custom-layers/writing-your-own-layer). It always contains the latest and most in-detail explaination of how things work.

Enjoy making visualizations with deck.gl!
